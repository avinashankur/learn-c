# Learn C
## _Learning C so that I can hopefully do epic shit_

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

## Why learn C?

- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.
- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.
- And because you have to pass the exams.

Stuffs I used/am using to lean C:

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) for an overview of the language
- [Online C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)- millions time better than that old Turbo thing.
- [Learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org/)- an overview of the language
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)- for a deeper understanding of language

And of course Learn C itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/avinashankur/learn-c)
 on GitHub.
